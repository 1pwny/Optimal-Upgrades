# Optimal Upgrades

This branch pares down the work of the main repository into more human-usable
data chunks. Specifically I'm filtering/sorting the CSV data via Excel to determine
a shortlist of the "best" module seeds for fully kitting yourself out.

## Preamble

You'll notice that each main folder (i.e. /Suit) has/will have a significiant number
of CSV files removed - those would be the files which contain data on modules that will
never be optimal, like the C-Rank ones.

You'll also notice a new file containing "Top 6s" in its title. These are where I
compile my top recommendations and, when necessary, reasonings and alternatives. Why the
top 6 modules, you ask? Because you can use any Suit/Ship/Freighter tech module at most
3 times in general inventory and 3 times in the tech inventory, meaning you'll need at
most 6 distinct seeds.

You can also just determine your favorite module's seed and use that over and over again,
but I personally like to have some variation. 

## Usage

You'll need a save editor that allows you to edit your inventory and your module's seeds.
I recommend NomNom (https://github.com/cengelha/NomNom) . Once you load your save into
the editor, you'll want to click on an already-installed module and edit its seed to be
whichever you want.

To repeat - don't edit the seed of an unistalled module, it's not going to do much. Install
first (or generate an installed module), then edit that seed.

Save, and when you next load into the game, you should see that your module has the stats
you want it to.
